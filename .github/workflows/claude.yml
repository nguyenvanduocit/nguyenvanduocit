            Update my README.md profile based on recent GitHub activity.

            Read: user_profile.json, recent_activity.json, recent_repos.json, README.md

            CRITICAL: Keep README under 40 lines total. Be extremely concise.

            ## Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen 👋

            Pi-shaped engineer: Backend/AI tooling (Go, TS) × AI agents/MCP × Product iteration

            ### Projects
            - **[project](url)** — one-line description (stars if notable)
            [max 6 projects, one line each]

            ### Now
            [2-3 bullet points of current focus from recent activity]

            ### Stack
            Go, TypeScript, MCP, real-time systems, developer tooling

            ### Connect
            [12bit.vn](https://12bit.vn) · Việt Nam

            ---
            *Updated: YYYY-MM-DD*
            ```

            Rules:
            - MAX 40 lines, no exceptions
            - One line per project, no paragraphs
            - No redundant sections (no "How I work", "Product thinking", "Technical depth")
            - Never mention all-in-one-model-context-protocol or dev-kit
            - Commit and push after updating

            ALSO generate profile.json with this structure:
            ```json
            {
              "name": "Duoc Nguyen",
              "tagline": "one-line positioning",
              "stats": { "years": 13, "commits": "5K+", "repos": 425, "stars": "1.8K" },
              "bio": ["line1", "line2", "...", "line10"],
              "projects": [
                { "id": "project-key", "title": "Project Name", "description": "one line", "tech": "Go", "url": "https://...", "stars": 79 }
              ],
              "now": ["Current focus 1", "Current focus 2"],
              "links": {
                "github": "https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit",
                "twitter": "https://x.com/duocdev",
                "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/duocnv",
                "blog": "https://12bit.vn",
                "website": "https://onepercent.plus"
              },
              "updated": "YYYY-MM-DD"
            }
            ```

            BIO GENERATION RULES (IMPORTANT):
            - Bio is LONG-TERM overview, NOT based on recent activity
            - Focus on: overall career themes, top projects by stars, total contributions, main languages
            - Write from high-level perspective: who I am, what I care about, my approach
            - Include: day job (Engineering Manager at FireGroup), side projects (aiocean.io), writing (12bit.vn, onepercent.plus), community (Vue.js Vietnam 2016)
            - IMPORTANT: Current company is FireGroup, NOT Sen Việt
            - Bio should be STABLE - only change if there's major career shift
            - 8-12 lines, personal and approachable tone
            - Use empty string "" for paragraph breaks

            OTHER RULES:
            - Max 6 projects (select by stars + recent activity)
            - Keep descriptions short (under 50 chars)
            - "now" section: based on RECENT activity only
            - Commit both README.md and profile.json
