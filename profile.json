    "I'm an Engineering Manager at Sen Việt, where I lead teams building real products. But my real passion lives in the side projects I build at night.",
    "",
    "Over 13 years, I've created 430+ repositories with 1.8K stars. My focus has evolved from frontend frameworks to backend systems and now AI tooling.",
    "",
    "I started Vue.js Vietnam community in 2016 when the framework was still new. That taught me the value of building communities around tools people actually need.",
    "",
    "These days, I'm building at aiocean.io—creating tools that make AI accessible through MCP servers, developer tooling, and infrastructure. Projects like jira-mcp (79⭐) and obsidian-open-gate (219⭐) come from solving my own problems first.",
    "",
    "I write about what I build at 12bit.vn and onepercent.plus. The writing helps me think through problems and share what I learn along the way.",
    "",
    "My approach is simple: build things that solve real problems, iterate quickly, and share openly. The best projects come from scratching your own itch."
