    "I'm a software engineer who builds tools that make other developers' lives easier.",
    "",
    "By day, I'm an Engineering Manager at FireGroup, leading teams building e-commerce infrastructure. By night, I'm shipping open-source projects at aiocean.io and writing about software at 12bit.vn and onepercent.plus.",
    "",
    "My approach is simple: build small, ship fast, iterate based on real usage. I gravitate toward Go and TypeScript for their balance of power and simplicity. Recently, I've been deep in the MCP ecosystem, building connectors that let AI assistants talk to tools like Jira.",
    "",
    "I care about creating leverage—tools that multiply what humans can accomplish. Whether it's Obsidian Open Gate (219 stars) helping people bridge their notes with the web, or Jira MCP (79 stars) letting AI assistants manage project workflows, I look for friction points and build solutions.",
    "",
    "In 2016, I co-founded Vue.js Vietnam, helping grow the community from zero to thousands of developers. That experience taught me the importance of documentation, approachable tooling, and meeting developers where they are.",
    "",
    "I've been writing code professionally since 2011, contributing to 430+ repositories with over 1,800 stars across my projects. I believe in the compound effect of consistent shipping—small improvements accumulate into significant impact over time."
