## Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen 👋

I'm a Pi-shaped engineer: deep technical expertise in backend systems and AI tooling (Go, TypeScript), active exploration of AI agents and the Model Context Protocol ecosystem, and product sense from shipping developer tools and iterating based on real-world usage.

### What I build

**[obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate)** — Obsidian plugin that solves the isolation problem of local knowledge bases. Lets you seamlessly integrate web content into your notes without breaking your flow. 215+ stars from knowledge workers who needed this exact bridge between their notes and the web. (TypeScript)

**[jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp)** — Go-based MCP server that makes Jira AI-native. Born from watching teams waste time on repetitive ticket operations. Now AI assistants can handle issue management, sprint planning, and workflow transitions directly. 75 stars, real teams using it in production. (Go)

**[InstantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode)** — Browser extension that eliminates context-switching when debugging frontend code. Click any element, ask AI about it—no copy-paste, no tab-switching. Integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous improvements from user feedback. (TypeScript, 50 stars)

**[mimaid](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/mimaid)** — Minimal Mermaid diagram editor because existing tools had messy, overcomplicated interfaces. Built with real-time collaboration using Liveblocks and Yjs. Solving the DX problem: clean interface, fast editing, no clutter. (TypeScript, actively shipping)

**[copilot-sdk](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/copilot-sdk)** — TypeScript SDK for direct GitHub Copilot API access. For developers who want programmatic integration with Copilot in their own workflows without the editor middleman. (TypeScript)

**[autosocial-trends](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/autosocial-trends)** — Daily automated trend research pipeline. Runs in production, delivering fresh trend data without manual overhead. Built to solve the content creator's problem: staying current without burning time on research.

**[socketrpc-gen](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/socketrpc-gen)** — Type-safe RPC over Socket.IO. Solves the DX gap where real-time communication breaks type safety, reducing runtime errors for teams using Socket.IO. (TypeScript)

### Current focus (Dec 2025)

**Shipping AI-assisted tooling**: Daily commits to mimaid (real-time collaborative Mermaid editor), iterating on build pipeline and deployment. Fixing TypeScript errors, integrating Claude AI via GitHub Actions for automated issue resolution. Not just building—actively debugging production deployments on Cloudflare Pages.

**Production automation at scale**: autosocial-trends runs daily trend research pipelines, shipping fresh data without manual intervention. Proven reliability through consistent automated execution.

**Exploring AI integration patterns**: Building copilot-sdk for direct GitHub Copilot API integration, testing how developers actually want to integrate AI into custom workflows beyond IDE extensions.

### Technical depth

- **Backend & systems**: Go for MCP servers, CLIs, and backend services. TypeScript for developer tooling and browser extensions
- **AI tooling**: MCP protocol implementation, agent orchestration, building bridges between AI capabilities and existing developer workflows
- **Real-time systems**: Collaborative editing with Liveblocks, Yjs, and WebSocket-based architectures
- **Type safety**: Prioritizing type-safe APIs across Go and TypeScript—type-safety as a design requirement, not an afterthought
- **Continuous delivery**: GitHub Actions workflows that ship improvements based on real usage and user feedback

### Product thinking

I build by identifying real workflow friction and shipping solutions:
- obsidian-open-gate: watching knowledge workers manually context-switch between apps
- jira-mcp: seeing teams waste hours on repetitive ticket operations
- mimaid: frustrated with bloated diagram editors when all I needed was clean Mermaid editing
- InstantCode: debugging frontend code shouldn't require constant tab-switching
- autosocial-trends: manual trend research was blocking content creation, so I automated it

Stars validate the problem exists. Daily commits and iteration prove the solution works. Production usage proves it's reliable.

### How I work

- **Ship early, iterate based on usage**: InstantCode integrated GitHub Actions after seeing user patterns. autosocial-trends runs daily because that's what real users needed.
- **Technical depth meets product sense**: Build MCP servers in Go for performance, but design APIs thinking about developer ergonomics. Type safety matters because it reduces user pain, not just because it's technically correct.
- **AI exploration with engineering discipline**: Testing MCP integrations, agent workflows, and AI-assisted coding tools—but always with production reliability in mind.
