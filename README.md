Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen ðŸ‘‹

I build AI developer tools and delightful developer experiences from Viá»‡t Nam â€” an unlucky programmer who keeps shipping.

### Currently building
- [instantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode): AI-powered DOM inspector to speed up frontend iteration (TypeScript)
- [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp): Go-based Model Context Protocol connector for Jira so AI can plan/execute work (Go)
- [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate): Bring the web into your Obsidian notes for smarter workflows (TypeScript)
- [socketrpc-gen](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/socketrpc-gen): Typesafe Socket.IO RPC generator for quick client/server prototyping (TypeScript)

### Focus & expertise
- **AI developer tooling**: MCP servers/connectors, agents, pragmatic automation
- **Plugins & DX**: Obsidian ecosystem, productivity-first UX, high-quality TypeScript tooling
- **Languages**: TypeScript for product UIs/tools; Go for reliable CLIs/services
- **Integrations**: GitHub Actions, CLIs, and APIs that fit real-world dev flows

### Recent highlights
- Iterating on [instantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode) and [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp)
- Advancing multi-service AI workflows with [all-in-one-model-context-protocol](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/all-in-one-model-context-protocol)
- Maintaining long-lived OSS like [vue-loading-spinner](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/vue-loading-spinner) (600+ â˜…) and [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate) (200+ â˜…)

### Selected OSS
- [vue-loading-spinner](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/vue-loading-spinner) â€” well-loved Vue spinner collection (600+ â˜…)
- [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate) â€” 200+ â˜… Obsidian plugin
- [all-in-one-model-context-protocol](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/all-in-one-model-context-protocol) â€” MCP server with AI search & integrations

### Elsewhere
- **Website**: [12bit.vn](https://12bit.vn)
- **Company**: Sen Viá»‡t
- **Location**: Viá»‡t Nam â€” open to collaboration and interesting problems

I care about useful software, tight feedback loops, and tools that make builders faster. If that resonates, say hi or open an issue on any repo.
