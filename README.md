## Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen 👋

I'm a Pi-shaped engineer: deep technical expertise in backend systems and AI tooling (Go, TypeScript), active exploration of AI agents and the Model Context Protocol ecosystem, and product sense from shipping developer tools and learning from real-world usage.

### What I build

**[obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate)** — Obsidian plugin for seamless web integration. Solves the problem of keeping your knowledge base connected to external context without disrupting your note-taking flow. Proven adoption with 215+ stars from knowledge workers who need this bridge. (215 stars, 10 forks)

**[jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp)** — Go-based MCP server connecting AI assistants to Jira. Makes project management AI-native by letting agents handle issue management, sprint planning, and workflow transitions. Built after observing repetitive Jira tasks that could be automated. (75 stars, 20 forks)

**[InstantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode)** — Browser extension bringing AI insights directly to webpage elements. Eliminates the context-switching tax when debugging frontend code—just click an element and ask. Recently integrated with Claude GitHub Actions for continuous improvement based on user feedback. (50 stars, 9 forks)

**[autosocial-trends](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/autosocial-trends)** — Automated daily trend research pipeline for social content. Running production workflows that deliver trend data without manual overhead, helping creators stay current. Active iteration with daily commits refining the automation.

**[socketrpc-gen](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/socketrpc-gen)** — Type-safe RPC framework over Socket.IO. Addresses the DX gap in real-time communication where type safety typically breaks down, reducing runtime errors for teams using Socket.IO.

**[copilot-sdk](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/copilot-sdk)** — TypeScript SDK for GitHub Copilot API. Direct integration for developers who want programmatic access to Copilot capabilities in their own workflows.

### Current focus

**AI-assisted workflows**: Actively building and iterating on MCP servers. Not just implementing specs—testing real integration points, observing where AI agents struggle in development workflows, and fixing those gaps.

**Automation that runs**: Building systems that operate daily in production (autosocial-trends), proving reliability under real usage before calling them done.

**Developer experience**: Every tool solves a specific friction point. InstantCode removes context switching, obsidian-open-gate connects isolated knowledge, jira-mcp reduces project management overhead. Product decisions come from watching how developers actually work.

### Technical depth

- **Backend & systems**: Go-first for MCP servers and CLIs, TypeScript for developer tooling and browser extensions
- **AI tooling**: MCP protocol implementation, agent orchestration, bridging AI capabilities into existing workflows
- **Type safety**: Prioritizing type-safe APIs across both Go and TypeScript stacks
- **Continuous integration**: GitHub Actions for automated workflows, CI/CD that ships improvements based on real usage

### Product thinking

I build tools by identifying workflow pain points and shipping solutions:
- obsidian-open-gate came from watching knowledge workers manually copy context between apps
- jira-mcp emerged from seeing teams waste time on repetitive ticket management
- autosocial-trends runs daily because manual trend research was blocking content creation
- InstantCode integrates with Claude because user feedback showed the need for smarter element analysis

Adoption and stars validate the problem exists. Daily usage and iteration prove the solution works.
