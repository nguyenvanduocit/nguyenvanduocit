## Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen ðŸ‘‹

I build AI developer tools and smooth developer experiences from Viá»‡t Nam â€” an unlucky programmer who keeps shipping.

### What I'm working on
- [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp): Go-based MCP connector for Jira that lets AI assistants plan and execute real work
- [instantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode): AIâ€‘powered DOM inspector for faster frontend iteration (TypeScript)
- [socketrpc-gen](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/socketrpc-gen): Typeâ€‘safe Socket.IO RPC generator for rapid client/server prototyping (TypeScript)
- [mimaid](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/mimaid): Minimal Mermaid editor focused on speed and clarity (TypeScript)
- Maintaining [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate): bridge the web and your Obsidian vault (TypeScript)

### Focus & expertise
- **AI developer tooling**: MCP servers/connectors, agentâ€‘ready integrations, pragmatic automation
- **Plugins & DX**: Obsidian ecosystem, productivityâ€‘first UX, TypeScript tooling
- **Languages**: TypeScript for products/tools; Go for reliable CLIs/services
- **Workflows**: GitHub Actions, CLIâ€‘first development, APIs that fit realâ€‘world dev flows

### Recent highlights
