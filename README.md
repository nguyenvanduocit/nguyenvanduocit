## Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen 👋

I'm a Pi-shaped engineer: deep technical expertise in backend systems and AI tooling (Go, TypeScript), active exploration of AI agents and the Model Context Protocol ecosystem, and product sense from shipping developer tools and learning from real-world usage.

### What I build

**[InstantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode)** — Browser inspection tool that brings AI directly to your webpage. Click any element for intelligent insights and frontend development help. Solving the context-switching problem developers face when inspecting and understanding UI code. (50 stars, 9 forks)

**[obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate)** — Web integration for Obsidian notes. Helps knowledge workers bridge the gap between their personal knowledge base and the broader web without leaving their note-taking environment. (214 stars, 10 forks)

**[jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp)** — Go-based MCP connector that lets AI assistants like Claude interact with Jira. Makes project management AI-native by enabling agents to handle issue management, sprint planning, and workflow transitions. (75 stars, 20 forks)

**[socketrpc-gen](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/socketrpc-gen)** — Type-safe RPC client-server using Socket.IO. Addresses the type safety gap in real-time communication, reducing runtime errors and improving DX for Socket.IO users.

**[autosocial-trends](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/autosocial-trends)** — Daily trend research automation for social media. Automated pipeline that keeps content creators informed without manual research overhead.

### Current focus

**AI-assisted workflows**: Building MCP servers and exploring how AI agents can integrate into real development and project management workflows. Not just building features—testing how developers actually use these tools and iterating based on feedback.

**Developer experience**: Creating tools that reduce friction. Every project tackles a specific workflow pain point: context switching (InstantCode), knowledge management (obsidian-open-gate), project management overhead (jira-mcp).

**Technical systems**: Go for reliable backends and CLIs, TypeScript for developer tooling and browser extensions. Focus on type safety, observability, and systems that hold up under real usage.

### Technical depth

- **Backend & systems**: Go-first approach for services and tooling, distributed workflows, reliability
- **AI tooling**: MCP protocol implementation, agent orchestration, context management
- **TypeScript ecosystems**: Browser extensions, Node tooling, type-safe APIs
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions, containerized builds, CLI-first development

### Product thinking

I don't just ship features—I ship solutions to real problems:
- InstantCode addresses the friction of context-switching during frontend debugging
- obsidian-open-gate solves the isolation problem in personal knowledge management
- jira-mcp makes AI agents useful for actual project management tasks

Each tool reflects iteration based on how developers actually work, not just technical capability.
