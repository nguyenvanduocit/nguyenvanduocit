Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen ðŸ‘‹

I build AI tooling and delightful developer experiences from Viá»‡t Nam. An unlucky programmer who keeps shipping.

### What I'm working on
- [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate): Bring the web into your Obsidian notes for smarter workflows
- [instantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode): AI-powered DOM inspector to speed up frontend iteration
- [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp): Go-based Model Context Protocol connector for Jira
- [dev-kit](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/dev-kit): A practical MCP dev kit for day-to-day developer tasks
- [mimaid](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/mimaid): A minimal, fast Mermaid editor for quick diagrams

### Focus & expertise
- **AI developer tools**: MCP integrations, AI-assisted workflows, pragmatic automation
- **Plugins & DX**: Obsidian ecosystem, productivity-first UX, high-quality TypeScript tooling
- **Languages**: TypeScript for product UIs and tools; Go for reliable CLIs and services
- **Integrations**: GitHub Actions, CLIs, and APIs that fit into real-world dev flows

### Recent highlights
- Iterating on [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate) and [instantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode)
- Building practical MCP connectors like [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp) and exploring multi-service AI workflows with [all-in-one-model-context-protocol](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/all-in-one-model-context-protocol)
- Maintaining long-lived OSS like [vue-loading-spinner](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/vue-loading-spinner)

I care about useful software, tight feedback loops, and tools that make builders faster. If that resonates, say hi or open an issue on any repo.
