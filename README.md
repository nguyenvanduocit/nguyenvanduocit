# Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen ðŸ‘‹

I build pragmatic AI developer tooling and productivity plugins from Viá»‡t Nam. I'm hireable and open to collaboration.

## Currently building
- [mimaid](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/mimaid) â€” a minimal, fast Mermaid diagram editor (TypeScript) Â· try it at [mimaid.aiocean.dev](https://mimaid.aiocean.dev)
- [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp) â€” Go MCP connector for Jira enabling agentâ€‘ready workflows
- [confluence-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/confluence-mcp) â€” Go MCP server for Atlassian Confluence (search, read, create, update)
- Maintaining/curating: [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate)

## What I'm focused on now
- Shipping improvements to `mimaid` (recent updates in October)
- Iterating and stabilizing MCP integrations: `jira-mcp`, `confluence-mcp`
- Exploring adjacent ecosystems: `neobrutalism` UI components, nodeâ€‘based editors (BaklavaJS), agent/realtime tooling
- Documentation and DX that make AIâ€‘assisted workflows reliable for builders

## Focus & expertise
- **AI developer tooling**: MCP servers/connectors and agent integrations (Go, TypeScript)
- **Plugins & DX**: Obsidian ecosystem, productivityâ€‘first UX
- **Languages**: Go for reliable CLIs/services; TypeScript for apps/tools
- **Workflows**: GitHub Actions, CLIâ€‘first development, typed APIs that fit real dev flows

## Elsewhere
- **Website**: [12bit.vn](https://12bit.vn)
- **Company**: Sen Viá»‡t
- **Location**: Viá»‡t Nam
- **Hireable**: Yes

I care about useful software, tight feedback loops, and tools that make builders faster. If that resonates, say hi or open an issue on any repo.
