## Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen 👋

I build pragmatic AI developer tools and reliable backends from Việt Nam. I'm hireable and open to collaboration.

### Currently building
- [research-orchestrator](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/research-orchestrator) — multi‑agent research orchestration with quality controls and verification
- [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp) — Go MCP connector for Jira enabling agent‑ready workflows
- [research-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/research-mcp) — Model Context Protocol for research tasks (Go)
- [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate) — bring the web into Obsidian notes (TypeScript)
- [useai-release](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/useai-release) — AI on Obsidian Canvas for structured thinking
- Notable OSS: [vue-loading-spinner](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/vue-loading-spinner) — widely used Vue spinners

### What I'm focused on now
- Strengthening MCP integrations across multiple repos (`jira-mcp`, `research-mcp`)
- Orchestrating reliable multi‑agent research pipelines (`research-orchestrator`)
- Go‑first tooling and durable workflows; GitHub Actions automation
- Polishing docs and usability for dependable AI‑assisted tooling

### Recent highlights
- Iterating across `jira-mcp`, `research-mcp`, and `research-orchestrator` to streamline agent workflows
- Continued improvements to Obsidian tooling (e.g., `obsidian-open-gate`, `useai-release`)
- Community‑trusted UI utility: `vue-loading-spinner`

### Focus & expertise
- **AI developer tooling**: MCP servers/connectors, orchestration, retrieval, DX (Go, TypeScript)
- **Languages**: Go for reliable CLIs/services; TypeScript for tooling and apps
- **Workflows**: GitHub Actions, containerized builds, CLI‑first development, typed APIs
- **Systems**: distributed workflows, observability, performance, reliability

### Elsewhere
- **Website**: [12bit.vn](https://12bit.vn)
- **Company**: Sen Việt
- **Location**: Việt Nam
- **Hireable**: Yes — open to consulting/contract and interesting collaborations

I care about useful software, tight feedback loops, and tools that make builders faster. If that resonates, say hi or open an issue on any repo.
