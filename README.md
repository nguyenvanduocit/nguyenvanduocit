## Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen ðŸ‘‹

I build AI developer tools and pragmatic automation from Viá»‡t Nam â€” an unlucky programmer who keeps shipping.

### Currently shipping
- [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp): Go-based MCP connector for Jira â€” agentâ€‘ready workflows (issues, sprints, transitions)
- [instantCode](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/instantCode): AIâ€‘powered DOM inspector for faster frontend iteration (TypeScript)
- Curating Vite resources via [`awesome-vite`](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/awesome-vite)
- [socketrpc-gen](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/socketrpc-gen): Typeâ€‘safe Socket.IO RPC generator for rapid client/server prototyping (TypeScript)
- Maintaining [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate): bridge the web and your Obsidian vault

### What Iâ€™m focused on now
- Shipping improvements to **jiraâ€‘mcp** and **instantCode** (active this week)
- Keeping longâ€‘lived OSS healthy: [obsidian-open-gate](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-open-gate), [obsidian-ai-assistant](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/obsidian-ai-assistant)

### Focus & expertise
- **AI developer tooling**: multiple MCP connectors and agent integrations
- **Plugins & DX**: Obsidian ecosystem, productivityâ€‘first UX, TypeScript tooling
- **Languages**: TypeScript for products/tools; Go for reliable CLIs/services
- **Workflows**: GitHub Actions, CLIâ€‘first development, APIs that fit realâ€‘world dev flows

### Elsewhere
- **Website**: [12bit.vn](https://12bit.vn)
- **Company**: Sen Viá»‡t
- **Location**: Viá»‡t Nam â€” open to collaboration
- **Hireable**: Yes

I care about useful software, tight feedback loops, and tools that make builders faster. If that resonates, say hi or open an issue on any repo.
