# Hi, I'm Duoc Nguyen 👋

I build pragmatic AI developer tools and research workflows from Việt Nam. I'm hireable and open to collaboration.

## Currently building
- [research-orchestrator](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/research-orchestrator) — multi‑agent research orchestration with quality controls and verification
- [jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp) — Go MCP connector for Jira enabling agent‑ready workflows
- [research-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/research-mcp) — Model Context Protocol for research tasks (Go)
- [hello-temporal](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/hello-temporal) — exploring Temporal for long‑running, reliable workflows (Go)
- [google-kit](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/google-kit) — Go utilities for Google APIs
- Notable OSS: [vue-loading-spinner](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/vue-loading-spinner) (widely used Vue spinners)

## What I'm focused on now
- Strengthening MCP integrations across multiple repos (e.g., `jira-mcp`, `research-mcp`)
- Orchestrating reliable multi‑agent research pipelines (`research-orchestrator`)
- Workflow engines and durability patterns with Temporal (`hello-temporal`)
- Better docs and developer experience for dependable AI‑assisted tooling

## Focus & expertise
- **AI developer tooling**: MCP servers/connectors, orchestration, RAG (Go, TypeScript)
- **Languages**: Go for reliable CLIs/services; TypeScript for apps/tools
- **Workflows**: GitHub Actions, containerized builds, CLI‑first development, typed APIs
- **OSS & DX**: Vue components and productivity‑first plugins

## Elsewhere
- **Website**: [12bit.vn](https://12bit.vn)
- **Company**: Sen Việt
- **Location**: Việt Nam
- **Hireable**: Yes

I care about useful software, tight feedback loops, and tools that make builders faster. If that resonates, say hi or open an issue on any repo.
